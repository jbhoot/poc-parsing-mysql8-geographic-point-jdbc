# README

This is a complementary script intended to prove a few points raised [in this issue](https://github.com/justbhoot/poc-node-mysql2-bug-srid-4326-mysql8).

## How-to

1. Install [scala 3.5.0](https://docs.scala-lang.org/getting-started/index.html) or above. Prior versions do not support running a script with inline dependencies.

2. Run the script with the required env vars:

```
$ MYSQL_USERNAME="user" MYSQL_PASSWORD="password" MYSQL_PORT=3306 MYSQL_SCHEMA=test_lat_long scala run main.scala

Incorrect: when the stored order (long,lat) is read mistakenly into (x,y):
x = 117.346173, y = -33.310932
x = 120.000000, y = -40.000000
x = -140.000000, y = -90.000000

Correct: when the stored order (long,lat) is read correctly into (y,x):
x = -33.310932, y = 117.346173
x = -40.000000, y = 120.000000
x = -90.000000, y = -140.000000

Done
```
